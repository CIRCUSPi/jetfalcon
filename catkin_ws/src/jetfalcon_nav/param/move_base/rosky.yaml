#base_global_planner: navfn/NavfnROS           # The name of the plugin for the global planner to use with move_base, see pluginlib documentation for more details on plugins.
                                               ## This plugin must adhere to the nav_core::BaseGlobalPlanner interface specified in the nav_core package. 
                                               ## (1.0 series default: "NavfnROS")

                                               ## This plugin must adhere to the nav_core::BaseLocalPlanner interface specified in the nav_core package.

recovery_behavior_enabled: true                # Whether or not to enable the move_base recovery behaviors to attempt to clear out space.
                                               ## Can see how to use in folder recovery 

clearing_rotation_allowed: true                # Determines whether or not the robot will attempt an in-place rotation when attempting to clear out space. 
                                               ## Note: This parameter is only used when the default recovery behaviors are in use, 
                                               ## meaning the user has not set the recovery_behaviors parameter to anything custom.

controller_frequency: 10.0    # The rate in Hz at which to run the control loop and send velocity commands to the base.
                              ## Default is 20.0 
controller_patience: 5.0      # How long the controller will wait in seconds without receiving a valid control before space-clearing operations are performed.

planner_patience: 10.0        # How long the planner will wait in seconds in an attempt to find a valid plan before space-clearing operations are performed.
                              ## Default is 5.0
conservative_reset_dist: 1.0  # The distance away from the robot in meters beyond which obstacles will be cleared from the costmap when attempting to clear space in the map. 
                              ## Note, this parameter is only used when the default recovery behaviors are used for move_base.

oscillation_timeout: 10.0     # How long in seconds to allow for oscillation before executing recovery behaviors. 
                              ##  A value of 0.0 corresponds to an infinite timeout. New in navigation 1.3.1
oscillation_distance: 0.2     # How far in meters the robot must move to be considered not to be oscillating.      
                              ## Moving this far resets the timer counting up to the ~oscillation_timeout New in navigation 1.3.1

                              ## If the frequency is set to 0.0, the global planner will only run when a new goal is received or the local planner reports that its path is blocked.

max_planning_retries: -1      # How many times to allow for planning retries before executing recovery behaviors. 
                              ## A value of -1.0 corresponds to an infinite retries.
